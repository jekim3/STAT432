# Goal

Classification model predicting the company (will be deleted later)

# Introduction

Uber and Lyft have became one of the most dominant taxi-service business around the major cities around the world, especially big cities in United States. However, when one visits big cities such as New York or Chicago, one realizes that there are plenty of traditional yellow cabs around the city. With this in mind, our group decided to study the traditional taxi market in the big city. With major taxi service companies still providing means of transportation, can we analyze the traditional taxi market from 2013 to present day. 

In an attempt to construct a meaningful and effective way to detect the taxi service provider company in Chicago, various statistical learning techniques will be applied to Chicago Taxi Service data from 2013 to present. The main goal of our model is to see if a certain taxi service company can be mapped according to the financial and trip logistics of each fares in Chicago. If such is possible, this could provide an arguments about those that criticizes Uber and Lyft as two monopolistic companies in taxi service industries. Possibly decide if staying in the traditional taxi business is worth it or not. 

# Data Description

The Chicago Taxi Trips data is from the Kaggle data sets. 

There are 23 columns of information about each trips. There are trip logistics information including trip starting and ending time stamps, trip duration and miles, pick up and drop off locations, latitude, and longitude. In additions, there are financial-related information of each trips including, trip fare, tips, number of tolls, extra charges, total trip costs, and payment methods. Finally, third categories include information about taxi and its company. More explanation of each columns can be found in the appendix of the file at the end of the project.
